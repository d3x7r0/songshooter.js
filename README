### Song Shooter

This is a simple javascript game that loads a given ogg file and generates enemies and the background from it's analysis.

Currently it only works on Firefox 4.0 or above. No Webkit support so far since the code uses the mozilla specific Audio API Extensions. A port to the Web Audio API is in the plans but it takes time.

This was built quickly for a College course so it's not much more than a tech demo at the moment.
